title: Final Proposal
---

### Proposal
I am going to use the MDIMAP data on the Sea level change and the sea level wetland adaptations data in order to compare locations of Maryland where there will be the greatest impact on structures, environment or etc. This could be a buffer or spatial querying finding the areas of impact of the sea level increase and see which counties are effected the most.

### Question
How much impact will sea level cause in 2050 and 2100 and if any which counties are most affected. This could include but not limited to wetland increase, structure loss, housing, etc.

### Data
So far:

Maryland Political boundaries to break up Maryland by counties
http://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/maryland-political-boundaries-county-boundaries

Maryland Sea Level Rise Wetland Adaptation Areas
http://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/maryland-sea-level-rise-wetland-adaptation-areas

If the site works eventually!

Maryland Mean Sea Level By County in 2100

http://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/maryland-mean-sea-level-by-county-in-2100

Maryland Mean Sea Level By County in 2050
http://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/maryland-mean-sea-level-by-county-in-2050

Maybe Baltimore Property data could be assessed later. Data given to us by Professor Dillion.

### Tools
I want to do a hexagonal grid on the areas of impact from the sea level rise. Followed by a heat map with the most affected counties and or shorelines. I could create a DEM to make it look better and make the water symbology nice for resemblance. If I have time I will do a python query in order to do the impact calculations areas. Once again if I still have enough time I will use geoda to see what the Morans law does to the data and see any trends or correlations.

### Question answered
If the analysis goes smoothly I should have an output that highlights the areas where sea level rise either changes more land to wet land or causes so previous building parcels to be over taken.

### More Involved

This is going to be more involved due to the time restraint of this final project. I am going to try and incorporate as much as I learned into this project in order to show a cool project and practice my skills. I chose the following components above because even though we have done them in class this time restraint is the real reason why this project is harder.
